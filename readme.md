Mia seo_ Project 1

This website is based on a "dynamic Identities" article.
 It is focused on logo design especially. The article explains a variety of methods for creating an effective and flexible design. 
	 my concept is based on makimg a dynamic style similar to the article i read. I used a variety of different colors, and typefaces and experimented visually with typography.
Overall, this project was incredibly fun and I was really engaged, spending a lot of time on this website. When I saw the final result, I was so excited to see all the changes come together.
	I am looking forward to practicing next project!
									Thank you Michael and Rijk
