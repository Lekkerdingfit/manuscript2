							<p>Dynamic identities have recently become a popular choice for many contemporary identity projects, but the concept of dynamic identity has been around for decades. In 1981 Manhattan Design created a ‘container’ mark for MTV. The letters in the logo had a fixed shape and position, but within the framework of those letters there have been thousands of variations of imagery, illustration and animation. A dynamic identity is essentially opening up one or more of the components to a dynamic influence.

								<div class="container">
								<h2>Contianer</h2>
						<p>The most obvious choice to create a dynamic identity is to approach the logo as a box that can constantly change its content. Playing with just one variable, such as colour or imagery, can already create great variety while remaining recognisable.</p>

								8.2 million people live in New York and each has their own unique perspective of the city. The NYC logo acts as a window to infinite imagery, representing the cities many diverse cultures.
						</p>

						<h2>Wallpaper</h2>
								
						<p>The most obvious choice to create a dynamic identity is to approach the logo as a box that can constantly change its content. Playing with just one variable, such as colour or imagery, can already create great variety while remaining recognisable.</p>
						<section>
							<p>As AOL is content, Wolff Olins created an identity that enables site visitors to discover the works of multiple artists and select a specific piece to be the wallpaper behind the AOL mark.
						</p>
								</section>

								<h2>DNA</h2>
								
								<p>Dynamic identities can also be created by supplying a toolbox containing several core ingredients. Various recipes can be created using these ingredients, resulting in a different outcome each time.</p>
									<section>
								<p>The identity for EDP was built using four fundamental shapes: circle, half circle, square and triangle (the DNA). The shapes were combined to forum 85 unique logos and hundreds of representational illustrations.
								</p>
									</section>

									<h2>Fomula</h2>
								
								<p>Instead of letting the ingredients be the core of the identity, one could also let the system be the constant. Whether it is a grid or a set of rules, it forms a language, a formula, that brings everything together</p>
									<section>
								<p>The VI for Management for Design is based on a formula that assigns each letter in the company name to colour and/or value relative to its position within the alphabet. Using this formula the identity can evolve with limitless interpretations of the data.
								</p>
									</section>

									<h2>Customised</h2>
								
								<p>Customisation is the first step towards letting the identity reflect a certain sense of community, creating and emotional bond.</p>
									<section>
								<p>The framework for the logo is based on the universities building designed by Will Alsop (British architect), but the content within that framework is designed every year by graduating student medal winners, making the students work part of the identity.
								</p>
									</section>

									<h2>Generative</h2>
								
								<p>Enabling at least one element of the identity to be influenced by external data — weather, stock market, news, tweets, number of visitors, status of a project, anything really — put it in real time. The identity can reflect the world it is living in.</p>
									<section>
								<p>On the Nordkyn tourism website the logo updates every five minutes based on weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The Arctic climate and dramatic weather conditions have become part of the identity itself.

					<p class="response"> As a graphic designer, I have created many logos over the past 7–8 years. These days, we are constantly exposed to countless logos in commercials and advertisements. Creating a company logo is extremely important for both the customers and the company itself. However, it is challenging to design a logo that remains memorable in people's minds. It requires coherence and creative elements. Traditionally, identities were always fixed and followed formal systems. However, I’ve noticed a growing trend of flexible, dynamic identities over time. This approach allows elements to shift and change across various contexts without losing their core character.
						The article effectively explains different methods to create dynamic identities, such as the container approach, wallpaper effect, and using a formula or DNA to guide variations. These methods show how designers can build a recognizable identity without losing its essence. The idea of customisation method reflects how brands can create a connection with their audience interactively, which is crucial in modern branding.
							 Additionally,it highlights the potential for diversity and adaptability in design, showing how changeable elements can produce different outcomes each time. It makes it possible to generate numerous variations constantly, which is highly beneficial in commercials. This approach can be applied to any design field, so we must keep these basic principles in mind when creating something.
						I also see a connection between dynamic identities and modernism design principles. Both focus on simplicity, clarity, and functionality. The logic isn't complicated, the answer always starts with basic and simple components.
						I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how identity design can move beyond.  It has inspired me to explore how branding can embrace more flexibility and interactivity.
